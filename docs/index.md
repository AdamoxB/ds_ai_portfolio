# Project from the world of data and artificial intelligence

Welcome to the page dedicated to projects in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Here you’ll find projects I’ve been working on recently.

Feel free to explore—hope you discover something interesting here!

## My short story

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In 2010 I graduated from the Electrical Engineering Faculty at Warsaw University of Technology, which sparked my interest in exploring new technologies.

Over the past two years I worked as a designer of electrical networks using AutoCAD; later I served as Senior Product Manager for lighting systems and then spent ten years as a Lighting‑Systems Designer where I honed skills in automating design processes.

In 2025 I was inspired by the data industry, the role of Data Scientist, and the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. An opportunity arose to further develop these skills by creating AI agents—automation that is not deterministic but can adapt far better to various process‑automation tasks, thereby reducing verification time and increasing overall efficiency.
